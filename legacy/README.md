# Legacy Code: No Longer Part of the Project 

Represent discarded attempts throughout the project.

## Under `/py`
 - `use_mlp.py`: used to be under `/src`. Used MLP (multi-layer perceptron model) for classifying emotions. Discarded due to low accuracy.
 - `recorder.py`: used be under `/web`. Attempted to record from backend. Discarded since browser-side recording is eaiser.

 ## Under `/js`
 - `bundle.js`, `script_new.js`, `rollup.config.mjs`: used to beunder `web/static`. Tried using external package for converting webm to wav on the web. Discarded because the bundling tool produced unsolved errors.
